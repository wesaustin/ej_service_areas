# ej_service_areas
 A project to test the implications of adopting different service area types on the conclusions of environmental justice analyses.
 
 The project aims to test how disparate risk may appear to vary when using county-based, zipcode, SimpleLab/EPIC, and/or Hall/Murray service area products.
